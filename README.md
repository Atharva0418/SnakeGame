# SnakeGame
The vintage snake game  built in java.
<br>
This is a 2D game where the snake eats the apple and grows bigger with each apple.
<br>
Touching the edges or its own body terminates the round.
<br>
I made this game to understand how a game is made responsive to keyboard.
<br>
And how code is used to design simple graphics in a game.
